# Summary:
In this paper, Wu and Xue et al. propose an end-to-end training framework called 3D INterpreter Network (3D-INN) using 2D heatmaps of keypoints to augment supervision. They overcome the need for 3D object annotations by proposing a Projection Layer that calculates 2D keypoints from a 3D skeleton. Learning a compact representation of latent parameters has applications in image retrieval (finding the most similar image in the database according to a given query) and visualizing how similar objects are related in objects in object-space (via t-SNE).

# Takeaway:
They focus on learning 3D object structures supervised by 2D labels.
