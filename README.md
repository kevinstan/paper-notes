# paper-notes

This contains my notes (in progress) of research papers I've read relevant to my undergraduate thesis, with topics ranging from deep learning, reinforcement learning, computer vision, and cognitive science. Papers are organized chronologically by publication date, and then further arranged by topic. Inspired by [Daniel Seita](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/Paper_Notes)
